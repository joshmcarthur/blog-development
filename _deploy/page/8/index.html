  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I&#8217;ve had to deal with a strange problem with rake tasks being run
using Cron, a UNIX tool for running commands on a scheduled basis. The problem
was basically the server being slowly strangled of resources across a forty to
fifty minute time period, as each time the rake task was run it would leave an
entire bash process sitting there consuming resources.
I had assumed that this problem was relating to the rake task exiting in a non-
normal fashion - an exception maybe, or just not returning something that bash
was requiring to say &#8216;OK, I can close now&#8217;. As it turned out, the solution was
even more basic than that.
The server is question is a bit of a prototype, as it&#8217;s using a system-wide
installation of RVM to mange two very different sets of gems. To help
integration with Passenger, each project directory has an .rvmrc file that
automatically sets the correct Ruby version and Gemset when that directory is
entered. RVM has a neat security feature however, that prompts you to view and
approve the file before it is executed for the first time - and, you guessed
it, this is what was tripping up Cron.
What was happening, is that Cron was changing directory to the release path in
order to execute the rake task - but not getting as far as actually executing
the Rake task. Instead, Cron was being presented with a security warning from
RVM, which was very cleverly sitting there waiting for input to approve the
file - causing Bash to sit there&#8230; for ever.
Fortunately, I did find a solution - it is possible to turn this security
mechanism file off, to stop it from prompting for approval of the .rvmrc file,
by adding a configuration flag to the default rvmrc file in /etc/rvmrc - here&#8217;s
the configuration flag:
export rvm_trust_rvmrcs_flag=1
(It goes inside what should be an if block).
From now on, when Cron runs the rake tasks, it won&#8217;t be presented with this
prompt - approval will be assumed. No more server resources limits exceeded
alerts!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Following an insanely interesting presentation by Steve Souders at Webstock, I
began thinking about ways to simplify (i.e. automate) certain processes to
optimize performance of sites. Something that immediately jumped out at me from
early on in Steve&#8217;s workshop (So early, I was able to start coding in the
halfway break), was that inline images were an ideal candidate for something
that is relatively easy to do, but could have a significant effect on overall
page load speed.
The concept of inline images has been around for a while, and basically
involves embedding Base64-encoded image data within the image tag like so:
<img src="data:image/jpeg;base64,[data] />
So, what impact does this have on performance vs. the normal technique?
Well, the normal technique involves several more requests - one per image, in
fact. As Steve pointed out in his workshop, server response time is only a
small part of the problem - the reality is that it doesn&#8217;t make a huge
difference how fast a piece of content is processed on the server - unless you
are doing something really wrong, of course. Where you can really hit
performance bottlenecks is actually in the request-response transaction -
waiting for data to be transmitted, received, processed, assembled, and
rendered on screen.
Using inline images can improve web performance when used appropriately, but as
with any other performance technique, it has it&#8217;s drawbacks. First of all,
because the images are actually embedded into the page, caching is affected -
browsers may cache images longer than static pages, and if your web server is
not set up correctly, dynamic pages may not be cached at all. Next, the
relative file size of the page is not equal to the page size without images
plus the combined images file size. The encoding process tends to result in
about a 30% increase in size.
Notice above I have said when used appropriatelyÂ - this means that, despite
the drawbacks above, it really can help web performance. The key to not
overusing this technique is to carefully consider the boundaries of what images
should be embedded - the best candidates are small to medium sized images that
do not generally change much - especially if there are quite a few of them on
the page and the server is slow - this means that your page load speed might be
slower, but there will also be no need to make several requests once the page
hasÂ loaded to draw in all of these assets. Large images, on the other hand,
should not generally be encoded. There is a fine balance between embedding
images into a page to save on requests, and overloading the page with embedded
images and ending up with a 2 or 3 megabyte page for the client to load. Large
images will shove up this page size, and in addition to this, they are usually
particular files that you want to apply a different caching policy to anyway.
In order to help out and generally feel good about my contributions to web
performance and open source, I have actually translated what I&#8217;ve written down
here into a piece of Rack middleware that creates inline images (Since I&#8217;ve
come across rack-pagespeedÂ since then, this middleware is probably
superseded), and embeds them into a page. This technique was nice because a) It
gave me a chance to learn how Rack middleware works with a practical project,
and b) because when myself or others wish to use it, all that needs to be done
is to drop the Gem into my Gemfile, run bundle install, and register the
middleware in my Application&#8217;s configuration - from there on, the middleware
will automatically parse responses from the Rails (Or any Rack-compatible
application, actually), and replace the <img src="file.jpg"> with encoded data.
Overall, this technique is not perfect - it&#8217;s definitely not something to be
overused, but with careful consideration and appropriate selection of images
it&#8217;s a good stepping stone to improved web performance.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While working at 3Months as a developer, I am also completing a Bachelor of
Business Information Systems at Victoria University. One of the things that
rolls around twice a year and always causes students headaches is the signups
systemÂ - it&#8217;s one of the bragging points of the School of Information
Management at Victoria, as it was build as a project by a group of students
there (Hence the name &#8216;S-Cubed = SSS = SIM Signups System). In itself, it&#8217;s a
good application - it fulfills it&#8217;s brief of managing signups for tutorials and
workshops, and lecturers and students alike seem to have no huge issues using
is. The problem is though, is that its performance under load is crap - it
simply was not build for the load that it receives when tutorial signups for 2
courses of 700 people each opens at 9am, and each of those 1400 people trying
to get the exact tutorial they want are continually refereshing the page and so
exacerbating the server load even more.</p>

<p>This server load doesn&#8217;t just extend to slow page load speed - since the site
has not been build with scalability in mind, there have been ongoing issues
with sessions expiring as people try and signup for a tutorial or workshop,
people stuck halfway through a transaction, and the server even goes down every
now and then.
What I am proposing is an open framework that takes the best aspects of this
type of system, and builds upon it techniques to optimize page load speed, and
increase scalability. It seems to me that Universities in general are lacking a
system that allows them to smoothly run signups (usually they are dependent on
modified forum software, paper signups, emails or proprietary in-house
systems), and so this isÂ definitelyÂ something that is marketable around the
world.
As I see it, here are the base requirements for such a system:</p>

<pre><code>* LDAP and OAuth Authentication so that students do not need to 'register'
  to sign up for a tutorial
* Accurate time-based releases of tutorials and workshops that do not
  require human intervention
* Automatic server load monitoring with the ability to increase allocated
  resources if necessary (i.e. this application is an ideal candidate for
  Rackspace Cloud or Heroku)
* Per-course and per-University analytics for better scheduling of tutorial
  and workshop release times and how students are accessing the system.
* The ability for lecturers and course administrators to export and print
  class lists, tutorial lists, and workshops list with all student data or
  just a subset.
</code></pre>

<p>This project isÂ definitelyÂ going on theÂ work pileÂ for my personal projects
- it&#8217;s got a couple of interesting aspects to it which I haven&#8217;t approached
before (Such as LDAP from Rails), and generally seems to follow along with my
ethos of community-oriented &#8216;responsible web applications&#8217;.</p>
