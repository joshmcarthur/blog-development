**Full Disclosure:** I'm a fourth-year student at Victoria University, and have completed the discussed paper (INFO101), as part of my wider BBIS degree.

I've long been cynical about the School of Information Management's qualification to educate students in technical areas, but I really do want to help and find a better way. I reviewed some INFO101 HTML assignments this evening, and talked to a student who has done it this trimester. I was astounded to find out that, not only were they not *told* about CSS, they were also penalized if they used it. Instead, the students were instructed (by tutors, who should know better), that formatting documents was done using things like `<font>`, `color="red"`, and other nasty things that were abandoned in the late 1990s. The thing that concerns me the most is that the students were actually discouraged from using CSS - and that's appalling. In any teaching role, not just those involving technology, surely it is just a central idea that you should never, **ever**, discourage a student from learning? Indeed, in any sort of development role, an inquisitiveness and need to try new things is a valuable trait.

My cynicism has now really changed to a kind of betrayal - we are counting on Universities to pump knowledgable graduates into the industry, and the School of Information Management is simply not qualified to teach undergraduates concepts that are this out of date. I wish I could say that it is simply a problem with this paper, but it's not. I have not yet completed a single paper through the School of Information Management that has been something that I use in my job as a web developer - literally, my degree has taught me nothing but how to complete academic research, largely on assignments whose subjects are themselves obsolete.

What's caused this problem? I think it's largely due to the entrenched nature of the staff working within the School - they are researchers, they are funded for doing research, and it's simply not in their interests to keep up to date with best practises. Perhaps this represents a larger failure of the University to take into account the fact that it is transitioning now into a state where it's expected to keep up to date with, and be able to teach, current best practises.

In my own opinion, this is what I would expect the University to teach in a first year practical course covering elements of web development:

* How to write basic queries in SQL, using an open source engine such as MySQL or PostgreSQL
* How to maintain basic source control using Git or SVN
* How to write semantic HTML, and control page formatting with CSS

Beyond 100-level papers, I would expect the School to cover the following topics:
* Web applications covering principles of MVC
* Creating and consuming APIs
* Managing servers and infrastructure
